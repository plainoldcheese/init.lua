# init.lua
rewrote my vimrc in lua, also added some nice stuff. mostly no bugs, quite minimal.

no snippet plugin but uses the builtin lsp for autocomplete. 
install the lsps using mason. 
also need to install some other packages. there are comments for where it's necessary 
dont forget to ``:checkhealth``
